    Diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes of the tree.
    Length between any two nodes is equal to the number of edges traversed to reach one node from the other.

            1 <= number of nodes in the given tree <= 105
            0 <= node value < number of nodes
    Node values are unique*/
